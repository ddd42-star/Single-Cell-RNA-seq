# Single-Cell-RNA-seq
Research Project


The respiratory epithelium serves as the primary entry point for respiratory pathogens and acts
as a crucial barrier to infection. However, the roles of various cell populations within the airway
epithelium and the distribution of innate immune components in both healthy and diseased ep-
ithelium are not fully understood. In this analysis, we aim to examine scRNA sequencing data
obtained from two AEC cultures derived from pig twins, one with cystic fibrosis and the other
healthy, that were infected with influenza viruses H1N1 and H1N1-R38A. First, we will identify the
cell types present in our cultures, then determine which cells are infected and which are not. Next,
we will conduct differential expression analysis across different conditions and explore transcrip-
tional signals to investigate the evolution of cystic fibrosis and its development in the context of
infection and immune response. We identified four distinct cell types in our cultures and calculated
the percentage of infected cells. Additionally, we identified differentially expressed genes linked
to cystic fibrosis and highlighted the varied immune responses across cultures. Given the genes
identified, further investigation into their biological roles and their potential relevance to cystic
fibrosis is essential. These genes may serve as promising targets for future treatments or provide
valuable insights into the progression and pathogenesis of the disease.
